# Introduction: 
Crowdfunding is a way of raising money by collecting small amounts from a large number of people (Backers), usually through online platforms such as Kickstarter. It helps individuals, start-ups, or creators to fund their projects.


# Purpose: 
In this project, I analyze and summarize the performance of projects conducted on the Kickstarter platform. The analysis is based on time, category, location, number of backers, and the total amount raised.
The reports provide insights into around 365K projects created between 2009 and 2019 across 22 countries and 169 categories.

# Features:
⚪ Overall projects by their status.  <br>
⚪ Number of projects created by date (2009 to 2019), places and categories.  <br>
⚪ Top N (dynamic) successful projects by number of backers and raised amount.  <br>
⚪ Success rate of projects in each category and in different time period. 

# Conclusions:
⚪ Around 365K projects were launched on Kickstarter between 2009 and 2019, with a 38% success rate and 51% failure rate, indicating strong competition on the platform.<br>
⚪ Project activity is concentrated in major cities, with Los Angeles, New York, and London leading in the number of projects created. <br>
⚪ The platform generated approximately $4 billion in total funding, of which about $3.48 billion was raised by successful projects, showing that most capital flows to projects that achieve their goals. <br>
⚪ High-funding projects such as Pebble Time, Coolest Cooler, and Pebble 2 dominated in terms of amount raised, while Exploding Kittens led in backer participation.<br>
⚪ Tabletop Games, Product Design, and Music emerged as the top successful categories by project count.<br>
⚪ Overall, project success depends mainly on location, category, funding appeal, and community support, with projects in major cities and popular categories showing greater chances of success.
