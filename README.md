# Introduction: 
Crowdfunding is a way of raising money by collecting small amounts from a large number of people (Backers), usually through online platforms such as Kickstarter. It helps individuals, start-ups, or creators to fund their projects.


# Purpose: 
In this project, I analyze and summarize the performance of projects conducted on the Kickstarter platform. The analysis is based on time, category, location, number of backers, and the total amount raised.
The reports provide insights into around 365K projects created between 2009 and 2019 across 22 countries and 169 categories.
